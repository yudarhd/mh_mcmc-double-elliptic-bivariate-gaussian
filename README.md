# mh_mcmc-double-elliptic-bivariate-gaussian

Hi everyone,

I Would like to share my programming of my final project to get a bachelor's degree from Institut Teknologi Bandung. That is about "An Application of The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Method to Open Cluster Membership Determination". 

The aims of that:
1. Determination of membership of open clusters using the parametric method from Sabogal-Martinez (2001) or known double elliptic bivariate gaussian equation
2. Parameter determination using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
3. compare the probability of open cluster membership with the catalog of MWSC II (Milky Way Star Clusters II) from Kharchenko, et al. (2013).

Happy Coding!
